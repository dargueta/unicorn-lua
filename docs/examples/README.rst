Example Programs
================

There are some example programs you can use to see how this library (and Unicorn
in general) works. Due to file path issues they must be run from inside the
directory they're in, or via the Makefile in the root directory of the repo:

.. code-block:: sh

     make run_example EXAMPLE=name

``name`` is the name of the directory the example is in, e.g. ``disk_io`` or
``cmos_time``.
